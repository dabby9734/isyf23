                        <p class="speaker-desc">
                            Sir David Klenerman FRS FMedSci is a British biophysical chemist and a professor of biophysical chemistry at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. He has developed and applied new methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy to biological and biomedical problems. His group is now focusing on super-resolution microscopy to find out more about  protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases.
<br><br>
He is one of the co-inventors (with Prof Shankar Balasubramanian) of the leading next-generation sequencing methodology, Solexa-Illumina sequencing. The method is based on solid phase enzymatic sequencing of vast numbers of DNA molecules on a surface in parallel, using novel fluorophore-coded nucleotides, to make a highly miniaturised, cheap and fast DNA sequencer. This allows rapid sequencing of the 3 billion bases in a  human genome for less than $1000 a day. Solexa-Illumina sequencing is widely used in both basic biological and biomedical research. It is also starting to be routinely used as part of medical treatments including non-invasive prenatal testing, cancer detection and treatment and the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases, particularly for children. 
<br><br>
For his work, Sir David has received numerous accolades, including being knighted by the Queen in 2019, for the development of high-speed DNA sequencing, and being awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 2018. Together with Shankar Balasubramanian, he was awarded the 2020 Millenium Technology Prize. Most recently, he has also been awarded the 2022 Breakthrough Prize for Life Sciences jointly with Shankar Balasubramanian and Pascal Mayer for next-generation sequencing.

                            Professor Peter Preiser is the Associate Vice President (Biomedical and Life Sciences) and a Professor of Molecular Genetics & Cell Biology at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. In 1981, he obtained his PhD in Philosophy in Biology from University of Delaware and continued his postdoctoral studies at Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology. In the initial stages of his research journey, Prof Preiser joined London's National Institute for Medical Research as a Senior Research Scientist. In 2003, he left London to join Singapore's NTU School of Biological Sciences (SBS).
<br><br>
Prof Presier's research mainly delves into the molecular mechanisms that allow the malaria parasite to avoid host immunity and adapt to the host cell environment. Recently, he and his team of scientists at NTU have discovered a key process that allows the malaria parasite to invade the host cell. Moving forward, his team plans to utilise this knowledge to work on a vaccine against malaria. 
<br><br>
Prof Preiser has worked with top research institutes around the world and has published over 100 top-quality international journal papers. He has been invited numerous times as an expert reviewer for local and international funding agencies, and international journals including Science, Nature, Nature Medicine, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

She then obtained her PhD in Oxford in 1995. She also moved to the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge in 1995. Following her Medical Research Council fellowship in Cambridge, Prof. Alison Woollard returned to Oxford in 2000 to take up her fellowship at Hertford College and subsequently, a University Lecturership in the Biochemistry Department.
                            <br><br>
Prof. Alison Woollard currently leads a research team working on the developmental genetics of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Her work mainly concerns molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination and morphogenesis during C. elegans development. This involves the unravelling of complex mechanisms by which cells become different from one another as an organism develops from egg to adult. 
<br><br>
For her outstanding career, Prof. Alison Woollard was awarded the 2015 Genetics Society JBS Haldane Lectureship. The award served to recognise her public engagement activities. Her BBC Radio 4 “Life Scientific” was broadcast in spring 2017 and she is involved in a diverse range of  public engagement activities  from pop festivals to stand-up comedy.  She also serves as Vice President of the Genetics Society with a special responsibility for public understanding of genetics.

## Code Methodology
HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6

## Advice
Copy from relevant past years' websites (updating with current info of course) unless something is obviously no longer relevant or teachers find something wrong with the content (which is rather unlikely given they approved it in previous years).

Good luck!
